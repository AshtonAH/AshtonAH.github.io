        <h2>Problem Statement: Campus Dining Times</h2>
        <p>
          Lines and wait times are often misrepresented, and students may miscalculate how much time they have  to wait or how much spare time they have before their next class.

        <p>
          My persona is a man named Seth Thompson, a grad student studying to be a lawyer. With a heavy workload, Seth is always busy and will take any chance he can to save on time. He needs to get food quickly and would be willing to pay for an app which would allow him manage his day better and increase efficiency.\

          He is known for his common quote "Efficiency is intelligent laziness" which sums up his philosophy pretty well.

          <p>
            These panels cover a generic day in Seth Thompson's experience as an employee for our app's company. In the process of grabbing lunch, Seth gained some valuable info regarding how our product is used and how he might improve upon it.
